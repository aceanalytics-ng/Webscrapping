# Webscrapping in R
Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet. This data is usually saved in a local file so that it can be manipulated and analyzed as needed. If you've ever copied and pasted content from a website into an Excel spreadsheet, this is essentially what web scraping is, but on a very small scale.<p>
This project was embarked upon to put to practice the knowledge and skills I gained while taking the Introduction to R for Data Science course curated by Coursera. Working on a real-world project seemed like a good way to put on my Data Analyst hat and try to solve an actual problem. <p>
In this project, I will be scraping **Covid-19** data off of **Wikipedia's HTML Page** using R's `rvest` library and conducting pretty basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).<p>
This project has been divided into two sections:<p>
1. Data Wrangling (Webscrappping, Data Cleaning, and Data Export)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis 
<p>It is worthy of note, however, that the main focus of this project is on data wrangling, not data analysis. To complete this project, I will carry out 5 predetermined steps/tasks.
