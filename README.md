# Webscrapping in R
Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet. This data is usually saved in a local file so that it can be manipulated and analyzed as needed. If youve ever copied and pasted content from a website into an Excel spreadsheet, this is essentially what web scraping is, but on a very small scale.
This project was embarked upon to put to practice the knowledge and skills I gained while taking the Introduction to R for Data Science course curated by Coursera. Working on a real-world project seemed like a good way to put on my Data Analyst hat and try to solve an actual problem.
