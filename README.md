# Webscrapping in Python and R
Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet. This data is usually saved in a local file so that it can be manipulated and analyzed as needed. If you've ever copied and pasted content from a website into an Excel spreadsheet, this is essentially what web scraping is, but on a very small scale.<p>
This repository contains notebook files for several webscrapping projects I had undertaken, either in an effort to put to practice the knowledge and skills I have gained while taking several data science/analysis courses, or as a pet project. Working on real-world projects is a great way to sharpen one's data skills and try to solve an actual real-life problem. <p>

I love scrapping the web for contents and valuable data that can be used to gain actionable insights into those data. 

Real world data (eg. movies data, covid-19 data. etc.) are scrapped off of **Wikipedia's HTML and other web pages** using R's `rvest`, and Python's `BeautifulSoup` libraries, and pretty basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted.<p>
<p>It is worthy of note, however, that the main focus of the projects in this repository is on data wrangling, not data analysis.

<p><b>For notebooks created using Colaboratory(on google colab), for a full preview of such notebooks (as some parts of the notebooks may not be fully visible on github), there's a link to the open the notebook on Colab (at the top left of the notebook)</b></p>
